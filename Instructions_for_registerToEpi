Instructions for "registerToEpi.m" (written for MATLAB 2015, should work for all versions)

This version does not require a STORM dataset, i.e. no STORM to PALM correlation, just speckle extraction

Line 4 : sample = 'C7' - Amine has his images and folders named uniformly like:
 "/Users/reyer/Documents/MATLAB/SOURCE_CODES/sample_images_matt/Matt_Microscope/2021_March2nd_SC35_M3/',sample,'/',sample,'_M3_F6_488.tif"
 where sample is automatically replaced by C7 in the following filepaths
 
You don't have to have uniform names like that. If you don't, just replace everything in the filepath variables with the full filepath of your images
If you do this, you don't need to change "sample", it won't change anything

Line 5: saveFile - filepath to where images are automatically saved. If you don't want to save the images, no need to change this, it doesn't matter

Line 7: repositionFigures = 1  - Change to 1 if you want the figures to automatically organize around the screen (though this was calibrated to my computer)
								- Change to 0 for standard output, i.e. figures will lay on top of each other
								
Line 8: saveFigures = 0   - Change to 1 if you want to automatically save figures to "saveFile" location (this takes a while, so probably change it to 0)								
							- Change to 0 if you don't want figures saved automatically
							
							
Line 10: gfp_path = Change this to the filepath to the 488 channel image, pre fixation. You can change the entire variable after the = to:

					gfp_path = 'example/path/to/sptPALM_488.tif';
					
					This is the "fixed image", i.e. the one whose coordinates will not be transformed. STORM spots are mapped on to sptPALM spots

Line 11: gfp_post_path = Change this to the filepath to the 488 image, post fixation. You can change the entire variable after the = to:

					gfp_post_path = 'example/path/to/STORM_488_post.tif';
					
					This is the "moving image", i.e. the one whose coordinates will be transformed			
					
Line 13 : epi_path = Change this to the filepath to the epi image of the STORM signal. You can change the entire variable after the = to:

					epi_path = 'example/path/to/STORM_EPI.tif';
					
					This is the image from which the speckles will be extracted	

		
					
Line 17: msd_file - This is the filepath to the sptPALM spot coordinates and diffusion coefficients, in the form of a .txt or .dat. 
You can change the entire variable after the = to:
					
					msd_file = 'example/path/to/sptPALM_data.dat';					
												
												
												
If the STORM and PALM data are in the same format as the ones Amine provided, these are the last things you have to change.
For the rest, you can just run the code

The only other thing you will have to do manually is align the sptPALM spots on top of the 488 image. You will see a pop-up window.

First window is up/down motion: - is move spots down, + is up (488 image will not move) (you can also leave blank for 0)

Second window is left/right motion: - is move spots right, + is left (488 image will not move) (you can also leave blank for 0)

Third window is if you want to continue translation or not: 0 means you are done, 1 means continue (DO NOT LEAVE BLANK. INPUT EITHER 0 OR 1)

If you are done translating the spots, you can either input 0 into the first two windows, or just leave them blank. Then, put 0 in the third window
Click "ok" for all steps. Do not click "cancel", or script will start over
